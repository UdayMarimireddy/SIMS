    <label>A nation's prosperity primarily depends on education, which creates wealth and well being. Technology is the key to safety, security, progress and prosperity. To build a safe, secure and prosperous India, we need to make higher technical education accessible and affordable with no distinction in caste, creed or color. Since independence, it has taken nearly more than six decades to emerge as a participant in global competition and an economic entity. The global competition is heating up, therefore, the educational philosophy at SVTM is found on the belief that our students should not only be professionals in their chosen careers but also all round personalities - knowledgeable and cultivated individuals with high personal, professional and ethical standards. Discipline, dedication, duty, dignity and determination are ingredients to all our learning programmes.
